# Cerium³ Modpack
Cerium³ is a Minecraft Modded 1.12.2 server, owned by **Lemon, Dire, and Pear.** The server requires [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/), and is powered by [SpongeForge](https://www.spongepowered.org/) to run plugins and mods at the same time.

## Modpack Installation
This modpack requires atleast 1 to 2GB of memory dedicated to your instance of Minecraft. A SSD is recommended in order for Minecraft to quickly load, but not required. As always, we suggests using MultiMC over the Vanilla Minecraft launcher.

### Vanilla Minecraft Launcher
1) Download the latest version of the modpack. 
2) Download 1.12.2 from Minecraft launcher.
3) Download the latest version of Forge, for 1.12.2
4) Run the Forge .exe and install the client.
5) Make a folder called `mods` in the folder `.minecraft` (located in `%appdata%` on Windows) and copy all the mods from the folder that has the extracted contents from the modpack.
6) Paste the mods into `.minecraft/mods`
7) Run Minecraft 1.12.2 Forge. Make sure to check that you have dedicated 1-2GB of memory to your instance.
8) You're done!

### MultiMC Launcher
1) Download the latest version of the modpack.
2) Download your copy of MultiMC by visiting https://multimc.org
3) Login with your premium Minecraft account.
4) Create a new instance, go to `Import from Zip` option and locate the modpack you just downloaded from Step 1.
5) Check its setting to be sure that proper amount of memory has been given.
6) You're done!
